Business Case Summary

Our firm processes large volumes of cross-currency payments throughout the day, which results in continuous fluctuations in our intraday cash balances across different agent bank accounts. When a currency account temporarily goes negative during the day, our agent banks provide intraday overdraft liquidity at no direct cost, provided the balance is restored before end-of-day. However, regulators assess liquidity usage in real time, and any intraday overdraft that lasts longer than one minute must be fully collateralized. To comply, we currently maintain approximately $9 billion of collateral, financed externally at roughly 125 bps, resulting in an annual cost of $70–$74 million. The objective of this initiative is to optimize how we manage intraday balances across currencies to reduce unnecessary reliance on collateral. This can be achieved through (1) strategically using intraday cross-currency swaps to offset surplus and deficit positions across currencies during different settlement windows, and (2) deploying temporary surplus liquidity into the intraday lending market when multiple currencies move in the same direction. Both approaches aim to reduce peak intraday overdraft exposure and improve utilization of available liquidity, ultimately lowering our collateral requirements and reducing overall cost while remaining within regulatory expectations.
