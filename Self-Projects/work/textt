Slide 3: The Problem
Wide variance in revenue even for clients with similar onboarding durations.

Examples:

Client A: 200 days to deposit | Revenue: $500

Client B: 200 days to deposit | Revenue: $1M

No current visibility on whether clients are exceeding cost-to-serve.

Slide 4: Proposed Approach
Calculate per-day cost of servicing a client.

Tag clients based on delay in first deposit.

Compare revenue vs cost to flag unprofitable clients.

Analyze cost differentiators (region, client type, etc.).

Build dashboard for monitoring.

Slide 5: Step 1 – Estimate Cost Per Day
Work with Finance/Operations to determine:

Fixed costs (platform, RM salaries, tech).

Variable costs (client interactions, compliance checks).

Calculate:

Cost per client per day (Avg across segments or customized by segment).

Slide 6: Step 2 – Revenue vs Cost Analysis
Join client revenue with onboarding-to-deposit timelines.

Calculate:

Total cost incurred until first deposit.

Net contribution (Revenue – Cost).

Define thresholds (e.g., negative net contribution after X days).

Slide 7: Step 3 – Identify Cost Drivers
Explore:

Region/Nationality

Client segment/type (HNI, NRI, etc.)

Relationship manager

Product mix

Use statistical analysis / segmentation to identify trends.

Slide 8: Step 4 – Dashboard Design
Dashboard KPIs:

Days since onboarding

Revenue generated

Cost accrued

Profitability status (Red/Amber/Green)

Filters: Region, RM, Client Type, Time Bucket

Auto-alert for red zone clients

Slide 9: Sample Dashboard (Mockup)
Include a simple mockup:

Table or bar chart

Profitability flag

Breakdown of costs and revenue

Slide 10: Next Steps
Finalize cost estimation with Finance.

Gather additional dimensions (region, RM, etc.).

Create and test dashboard prototype.

Roll out to IWM business team.
