Context
Intraday liquidity strain is often driven by payment timing and sequencing rather than an absolute shortage of cash. Rule-based or first-come payment processing can create unnecessary intraday low points, increasing reliance on overdrafts and collateral.

Scope
The scope covers optimization of inter-entity and selected external payment releases using algorithmic sequencing, while adhering to settlement cutoffs, regulatory requirements, counterparty priorities, and operational risk controls.

Systems Impact
	•	Introduces an optimization layer on top of existing payment and treasury platforms
	•	Consumes intraday balances, payment queues, cutoff times, and forecast inflows
	•	Outputs optimized payment sequencing and release timing without altering core settlement systems
	•	Minimal disruption to existing operational workflows

Key Benefits
	•	Reduces intraday low points and peak overdraft usage
	•	Lowers collateral and reserve requirements
	•	Improves liquidity utilization across currencies and entities
	•	Reduces manual intervention and reactive liquidity management
	•	Enhances regulatory resilience without impacting client service levels
