So just to set the context — during the day, we’re processing payments across multiple currencies, and our balances in each of those agent bank accounts are constantly moving up and down. Now, if one of those currency accounts goes negative intraday, the agent bank usually allows us to use their funds for free, as long as we bring the balance back to zero before end-of-day. The catch is that regulators look at this in real-time, not end-of-day. So if we use that intraday credit for more than a minute, we’re required to hold collateral against it.

Right now, to stay compliant, we maintain about $9 billion in collateral, and since we borrow that collateral, it costs us roughly 1.25%, which works out to around $70 to $74 million a year. The whole point of the optimization we’re discussing is to reduce how much collateral we actually need.

The idea is that, when we have surplus in one currency and deficits in another during the day, instead of letting one currency sit idle and another go negative, we can do short-term intraday swaps — basically lending out the surplus currency and borrowing the short currency for just those few hours. And in cases where multiple currencies are all in surplus at the same time, we can actually lend that liquidity out to other banks on an intraday basis and earn something on it, instead of leaving it idle.

Both of these approaches help us rely less on intraday overdraft from agent banks, which in turn means we can reduce the amount of collateral we need to hold — and that’s where the real cost savings come from.
