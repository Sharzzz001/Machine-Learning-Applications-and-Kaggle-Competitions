Our team recently implemented an AI-driven solution to standardise the free-text block reasons captured across IWM Operations. Since users enter notes in different styles, reporting and analysis were difficult. Using BERTopic, we identified 13 recurring themes from historical data by analysing the context and meaning behind each note. New entries are now classified automatically using semantic embeddings and cosine similarity, ensuring they map to the right category without relying on keywords. Unclear cases are flagged as Uncategorized instead of being force-fit.
This approach reduces manual review, improves transparency, and provides consistent insights into why accounts are blocked.
