To improve transparency around account blocks, our team introduced an AI-driven approach to standardise the free-text block notes recorded across IWM Operations. These notes vary widely in wording, making manual review and reporting time-consuming. Using BERTopic, we analysed historical entries and identified 13 recurring themes by understanding the context behind each note rather than relying on keywords.
New block notes are now classified automatically using semantic embeddings and cosine similarity, which measure how closely a new entry aligns with each topic’s meaning. If a note doesn’t match any topic confidently, it is marked as Uncategorized instead of being forced into an incorrect group.
This solution reduces manual effort, increases consistency, and provides clearer insight into the operational drivers behind account blocks—enhancing both efficiency and governance.
