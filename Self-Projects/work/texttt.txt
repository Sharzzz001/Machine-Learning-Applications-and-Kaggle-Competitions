Sure — here’s a clean, structured version you can speak in a meeting or put on a slide.

Overview
	•	We needed a way to ensure that client accounts requiring transfer/total blocks were being accurately identified and maintained based on free-text block comments.
	•	Since there are 2,000+ high-net-worth client accounts and the comments are not standardized, manual review was slow and prone to error.
	•	After an escalation highlighted this gap, I developed an NLP-based automation to categorize and surface accounts needing review.

Solution (What the model does)
	1.	I used topic modeling to identify the major reasons why accounts are placed under transfer or total block.
	2.	Then I applied a Sentence Transformer embedding model to semantically analyze the free-text block comments for all client accounts.
	3.	The approach allows us to group accounts based on meaning, not just keyword matches — this handles spelling variations, phrasing differences, and free-form text.
	4.	The script outputs:
	•	Top recurring block reasons
	•	How many accounts fall under each reason
	•	And most importantly, which cases remain unclassified and need manual review
	5.	This reduces the review set from ~2,000 comments down to ~40–50 prioritized cases.
	6.	The process is now repeatable and can be re-run monthly/weekly to maintain ongoing controls.

Benefits
	•	Massive time savings: Manual review reduced by ~95%.
	•	Higher accuracy and consistency in identifying accounts that require blocking.
	•	Provides clear audit trail of how decisions were made based on text interpretation.
	•	Reduces operational and compliance risk by making sure no required block is missed.
	•	Helps avoid future audit escalations, since block decisions are now systematic, reviewed, and explainable.

One-Line Summary to Say in Meeting

“We automated the interpretation of free-text block comments using topic modeling and sentence-transformer NLP, reducing the review workload from ~2,000 accounts to ~40–50 and improving both control accuracy and audit defensibility.”
