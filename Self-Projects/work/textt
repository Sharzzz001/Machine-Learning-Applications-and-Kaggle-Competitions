1. Understanding Work Distribution
Activity, Sub-Activity, and Sub-Process Analysis:

Identify high-effort activities consuming the most time.

Look for activities with low complexity but high effort, as these may be automated or optimized.

Identify repetitive or redundant work across multiple sub-processes.

Categorization by Effort & Volume:

Categorize work based on time spent per task.

Rank tasks by frequency and total time impact.

Identify tasks with long completion times and potential bottlenecks.

2. Identifying Automation & Efficiency Gains
Standardization Opportunities:

Are some processes performed inconsistently across team members?

Can processes be streamlined or standardized to improve efficiency?

Automation Scope:

Are there manual data entry tasks that can be automated?

Are there decision-based but rule-driven tasks suitable for automation?

Work Duplication:

Are different teams handling similar tasks that can be centralized?

Are there unnecessary approval layers slowing down processes?

3. Workload Balancing & Role Optimization
Workload Distribution:

Are some employees overloaded while others have bandwidth?

Are there peaks and troughs in workload across months or weeks?

Skill-Based Allocation:

Are high-skilled employees performing low-value tasks?

Can some tasks be shifted to lower-cost resources?

4. Measuring FTE Efficiency
FTE per Activity:

Calculate FTE effort per activity and compare against benchmarks.

Identify tasks consuming high FTEs but producing low-value outputs.

Cycle Time & Turnaround Analysis:

Identify processes with long turnaround times.

Compare actual effort vs. estimated effort.

5. Additional Data Required
To refine the analysis, you may need:

Time Tracking Data – Hours logged per activity/sub-activity.

Process SLA Metrics – Expected vs. actual completion time.

Error Rates & Rework Efforts – Identify inefficiencies causing repeat work.

System Logs & Manual Inputs – To assess automation potential.

Work Volume Trends – Identify seasonal spikes affecting FTEs.

6. Expected Outcomes
By analyzing the dataset with the above approach, you can:

Reduce FTE efforts by eliminating unnecessary/repetitive tasks.

Improve efficiency by automating rule-based processes.

Optimize workforce allocation by balancing workload effectively.

Enhance process turnaround times by removing bottlenecks.
