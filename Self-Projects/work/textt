Dear HR-CSR Team,

I hope you are doing well.

I am writing to seek some clarification regarding the selection for the Powai Run 2026 (10K category). I had received the invitation email and submitted the registration form almost immediately—within approximately five minutes of receiving the link. I also have a downloaded copy of my form response, which reflects the submission timestamp.

However, I later received a communication stating that I was not selected. I wanted to understand how the selection process works—specifically, whether registrations are evaluated on a first-come-first-serve basis, through a lucky draw, or via some other criteria.

Additionally, in case of any dropouts or cancellations, I wanted to check if there is a waiting list or if my application could be considered for prioritisation, given the early submission.

I would appreciate any clarification you can provide. Thank you for your time and support.
