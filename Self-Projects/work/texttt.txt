Context

Name screening is a mandatory control in IWM onboarding and periodic reviews to identify adverse media risks.
The current ASAM-based screening approach generates a high volume of false positives due to conservative relevance thresholds, common names, and multilingual news sources.
This results in significant manual effort and inconsistent outcomes across reviewers.

Problem Statement

ASAM relies primarily on name-matching logic, leading to many irrelevant alerts despite using verified client data in AVQ and KYC-E.
Operations teams must manually review each article to confirm identity relevance and adverse nature, impacting turnaround times and scalability.

⸻

High-Level Solution

Introduce an AI-assisted screening layer using the firm’s LLM platform Chinou to augment ASAM outputs.
Chinou will analyse article content against client attributes from AVQ and KYC-E to determine identity relevance and adverse classification.
AI outputs will support, not replace, analyst decision-making.
