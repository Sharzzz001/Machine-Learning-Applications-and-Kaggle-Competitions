Key Achievements
	•	Successfully deployed OCR and computer vision models to automate document handling processes, improving efficiency and accuracy.
	•	Built and deployed MI dashboards for senior stakeholders, enabling better decision-making through real-time insights.
	•	Applied LLMs/ML techniques to streamline data analysis and reduce manual intervention.
	•	Collaborated across IWM SSG and CSG operations teams, gaining exposure to multiple functional areas.
	•	Represented the India team in Singapore IWM Ops, contributing to regional projects and knowledge sharing.

⸻

What went well (Work + overall)
	•	Seamless collaboration across multiple teams, which broadened my domain knowledge in operations.
	•	Ability to apply data science skills (OCR, ML, dashboards) to real operational challenges, delivering tangible value.
	•	Strong support from both local and Singapore colleagues, which helped in quicker project turnarounds.

⸻

What you wanted to do but could not do
	•	Wanted to explore advanced generative AI/LLM integration into more business workflows, but scope and priorities limited this so far.
	•	Could not yet work on end-to-end automation (from ingestion to reporting) in some projects due to dependency on other teams.

⸻

Areas of your strength
	•	Technical skills: ML, data analysis, OCR/vision models, dashboarding.
	•	Problem-solving: Translating operational challenges into data-driven solutions.
	•	Cross-team collaboration: Building rapport across India and Singapore teams.
	•	Adaptability: Quickly picking up new processes across different sub-domains (SSG, CSG).

⸻

Your learning
	•	Business: Gained deeper understanding of IWM operational workflows, especially around SSG and CSG.
	•	Technical: Hands-on deployment of OCR and vision models, improved dashboard design skills, and exposure to integrating ML/LLMs with business processes.

⸻

Contribution to Team
	•	Delivered scalable data science solutions that reduced manual effort.
	•	Shared knowledge of ML/LLMs with colleagues through discussions and demos.
	•	Acted as a bridge between teams in India and Singapore, aligning technical solutions with operational needs.

⸻

Areas of Improvement
	•	Need to enhance stakeholder communication (simplifying technical explanations for non-technical users).
	•	Improve time management while balancing multiple parallel projects.
	•	Explore deeper automation opportunities using GenAI and predictive analytics.

⸻

Anything specific you want me to know
	•	I’m motivated to take on more responsibility in end-to-end projects, not just the technical part but also stakeholder alignment and delivery.
	•	Open to exploring cross-regional opportunities if they help drive AI/ML adoption across Nomura Ops.

⸻

Your plan for coming 6 months
	•	Expand OCR and ML solutions to other teams/functions where manual processes can be optimized.
	•	Work on a POC for LLM-based automation (e.g., SOP chatbot, text summarization for ops).
	•	Upskill in cloud deployment and model monitoring to make solutions more production-ready.
	•	Contribute more towards governance/standardization of data science practices within Ops.
