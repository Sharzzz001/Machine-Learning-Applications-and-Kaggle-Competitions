Automating Block Reason Classification Using AI Topic Modelling

In our IWM Operations environment, users often record block reasons as free-text notes when an account is placed on transfer block or total block. While this approach allows flexibility, it also creates challenges: the wording is inconsistent, phrasing varies across users, and reporting requires significant manual review. Similar issues arise with short abbreviations, typos, and different writing styles — all of which make structured analysis difficult.

To address this, the team has implemented an AI-driven topic modelling solution that automatically converts these unstructured block notes into standardised, meaningful categories, significantly improving transparency and operational efficiency.

🔎 How It Works

1. Discovering Natural Topics with BERTopic

The first phase involved using BERTopic, a modern NLP technique that groups semantically similar text entries without relying on exact keywords. Instead, it leverages context-aware embeddings, which capture the meaning of a sentence by analysing:
	•	Self-attention: how important each word is relative to others in the sentence
	•	Word embeddings: numerical representations of word meaning
	•	Positional encoding: understanding word order and context

Using this method, the model automatically identified 13 recurring themes across thousands of historical block notes — such as missing documentation, screening exceptions, or regulatory holds.

2. Classifying New Notes Using Semantic Similarity

Once the key topics were identified, we created a lightweight classification layer using cosine similarity.
	•	Each topic has a stored reference vector (its semantic “signature”).
	•	When a new block note comes in, it is converted into a vector using the same Sentence Transformer model.
	•	Cosine similarity then measures how close the new note is to each topic.
	•	If the score passes a confidence threshold, the note is assigned to that category; if not, it is marked as Uncategorized for review.

This ensures that the system does not “force-fit” unclear or unfamiliar entries, while also enabling continuous learning as new patterns emerge.

📈 Business Impact
	•	Structured insights from previously inconsistent free text
	•	Reduced manual review for analytics, reporting, and controls
	•	Improved visibility into block trends and underlying drivers
	•	Auditability, as each classification is supported by a confidence score
	•	Scalability, with the model adaptable to new categories over time

This initiative demonstrates how AI can enhance operational precision and reduce manual effort, while preserving full governance and transparency.
